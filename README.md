# SIFT-Image-Registration
SIFT, or Scale Invariant Feature Transform, is a feature detection algorithm in Computer Vision. 
SIFT algorithm is used for feature extraction and matching to register the image. 
The features extracted are scale and rotation invariant that can be used for various computer vision applications, 
like image matching, object detection, scene detection, etc.
